        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <p>Now that you have assembled the necessary ingredients, let's make the muffins!</p>
            <ol>
                <li>First, preheat your oven - 375 degrees</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Next, let's mix the wet ingredients.</p>
            <ol start=2>
                <li>Place the brown sugar in a small bowl.</li>
                <li>Add the melted butter and mix vigorously until the butter and sugar become one.</li>
                <li>Crack the egg into this mixture and whip it.</li>
                <li>Add the milk and vanilla and give it one last stir.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Ok, now let's mix the dry ingredients.</p>
            <ol start=5>
                <li>Scoop the flour into a new bowl, larger than the bowl with the wet ingredients.</li>
                <li>Add the oats, crushed pecans, spices and baking powder and mix well.</li>
                <li>Mix so well that the mix is one, with no one ingredient separate from the rest.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Now, add your wet to dry ingredients and fold together.</p>
            <ol start=8>
                <li>Side project - take some of the last of the melted butter from the bowl or pan you melted it in and apply this to your muffin tin.</l>  
                <li>This way, you'll be ready to go right after adding the blueberries.</li> 
                <li>Now the fun part - Add the Blueberries!</li>
                <li>The mix should get slightly purple and look chunky and thick.</li>
            </ol>   
            <p>You're ready to portion and bake. Almost there!</p>
            <ol start=12>
                <li>Portion the mix equally into the six compartments.</li> 
                <li>Place in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes</li>
                <li>After time has elapsed, your kitchen should be filled with the pleasant anticipation and smell of muffins!</li>
                <li>Take the muffins out and remove them from the tin. Let cool.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Wait as long as you can, but definitely eat at least one while still warm. Enjoy!</p>
